Testing running time the unbalance tree takes a long time inorder tranverse vs the java TreeMap is faster.
Even though my unbalance tree inorder transverse isn't working correctly I would presume it wouldn't work 
because of a unbalance tree inorder would take a very long tranverse from height to left node to root to 
right node because the depths of different subtrees. If my tree was balance with a working keySet with inorder 
the running time would very fast compares to the util TreeMap.
