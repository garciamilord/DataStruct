    The java build in Priority Queue is data structure is basically is heap implementation act like a Queue.
    Vs my binary heap its was a lot slow to my in comparision of time I run several test with different versions
    my binary heap it constantly when I run my several time my binary heap is faster I deduce is because he time it
    performance less operation vs the Priority Queue build in java library has both the min-heap and max-heap.
